# :closed_book: About

Felix Icons is a library of vector icons I have created to be used by myself or to anyone else that finds this interesting. The purpose when I made this was to get away from the commom "premium/pro" kind of thing we often see around. I don't have anything against it, but I just didn't want to let that be the limit. When I was exploring React Native with Expo, I was amazed of the enourmous library of ions that Expo set available to use, all for free. It was also based on that that I've decided to make my own icons, to use whenever I needed.
